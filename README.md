# Sudoku Solver (C++)

This project solves 9x9 Sudoku puzzles using recursive backtracking.

## How It Works
- Empty cells are represented by `0`
- Validates number placement across rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids
- Uses recursion and backtracking to solve the board

## How to Compile and Run

```bash
g++ sudoku_solver.cpp -o sudoku
./sudoku
```
